## Take Away
### How to Think Like an Architect
  1. Read these books
     - Fundamental of Software Architecture
     - Software Archiecture - The Hard Part
  2. The first law of software archiecture - *Everything in software architecture is a tradeoff* 
  3. Tecnical Depth vs Technical Breadth
     - Stuff you know - *Technical Depth*
     - Stuff you know you don't know (+ Stuff you know) - *Technical Breadth*
     - Stuff you don't know you don't know
  4. Daily invest atleast 20 mins on yourself to increase technical breadth
     - [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/)
     - [Dzone Refcards](https://dzone.com/refcardz)
     - [Thoughtworks Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar)
### Software Architecture: The Hard Parts 
  1. How to analyze Trade-offs?
      - Business Drivers (*Time to market*) -> Architecture Characteristics (*Maintainability*,*Testability*,*Deployability*) -> Trade off Analysis (*Performance*,*Maintenance*)
      - Watch out for "out of context" trap when analyzing trade-offs. - *Shared lib vs Shared service*
      - Model relevant business scenarios to extract trade-offs - *One payment service vs Multiple services with each payment type*
      - Compare like things - *MECE lists (Mutually exclusive [no overlaps], Collectively exhuastive[cover entire space])* 
      - Avoid over evangelizing a particular solution or technology - *Topic vs Queue*
      - Don't overwhelem your business stakeholders with too many trade-off choices - *Sync vs Async*
      - Use qualitative analysis to iterate on design, leading to quantative analysis
  2. There is no silver bullet in software architecture
### Meta-modern Software Architecture
  1. Prefer duplication over coupling
  2. Data Mesh - *A data mesh is a decentralized data architecture that organizes data by a specific business domain—for example, marketing, sales, customer service, and more—providing more ownership to the producers of a given dataset*
  3. Service Mesh - *In software architecture, a service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for facilitating service-to-service communications between services or microservices using a proxy*

### Upgrade to Modern Java
  1. Java is Agile because of 6 month release cycle after Java 10.
  2. JDK 20 released in March 2023 and JDK 17 is LTS.
  3. Function Interface
      - Consumer - *Take input and return nothing*
      - Supplier - *Take no input and return output*
      - Function - *Take input and return output*
      - Predicate - *Take input and return boolean*
  5. Stream API
  6. Lambda Function
  7. CompletableFuture
  8. Type Inference
  9. var keyword
  10. Http Client
  11. Text Blocks
  12. Record
  13. Sealed classes/interfaces
  14. Switch expressions
  15. Pattern matching for switch expressions
  16. JPMS(Java Platform Module System) is good for only public libraries

### Granularity & Communication for Microservice Architectures
  1. Service granularity disintegrators - *When should I consider breaking apart a service*
     - service functionality
     - code volatality
     - throughput and scalability
     - fault tolerance
     - access restriction
  2. Service granularity integrators - *When should I consider putting services back together*
     - database transactions
     - data dependencies
     - workflow & coreography 
  3. Difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous communication
  4. Difference between Orchetration and Choreography workflows
  5. Distributed transactions are very difficult to implement, if possible we should try to avoid it
  6. Transactional Sagas - *Total 8 sagas possible based on below combinations*
     - Communication - Sync/Async
     - Consistency - Atomic/Eventual
     - Coordination - Orchestration/Choreography
      
### Testing Software Architecture
   1. Operational Characteristics
      - Performance
      - responsiveness
      - availability
      - scalability
      - elasiticity
      - data intigrity
      - fault tolerance
      - data consistency
      - recoverability
      - security
      - concurrency
      - reliability
   2. Structural Integrity - *The law of demeter (principle of least knowledge)*
      - [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) - *Unit test java architecture*
   3. Fitness functions - *An architectural fitness function provides an objective integrity assesement of some architectureal characteristic(s).*
      - Triggered - *Pre Production*
      - Continious - *Post Production*

### Spring Apps at Scale - from 0 to 5B to 100B+ Requests
   1. [Azure Spring Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/products/spring-apps/) - *Build and deploy Spring Boot applications with a fully managed service from Microsoft and VMware.*
   2. Spring Cache
   3. Reactive Spring
   4. Spring Native - GraalVM

### Decomposition Patterns
   1. Identify and size logical components - *The larger the component the more coupled it is from rest of the system*
   2. Flatten components - *Root namespaces(packages) should not have any code in it*
   3. Analyze component dependencies - *There are tools available*
      - [Xray (Eclipse Plugin)](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/x-ray-software-visualization)
      - [Sonargraph](https://www.hello2morrow.com/products/sonargraph)
   4. Create domain component
   5. Create domain service
   6. Microservices system - 
      - It is not mandatory to break each domain service to microservices
      - Each microservice should have seperate database
